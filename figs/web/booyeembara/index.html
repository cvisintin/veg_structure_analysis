			<p class="image__description">Density describes the interstitial space within the foliage. This is
				primarily an aesthetic metric that is used by the designer, however, may
				have implications for target species. Density categories should be
				balanced across the site unless target species are identified - in
				which case beneficial classes may be more dominantly represented.</p>

			<p class="image__description">This plot represents the proportion of plants that will fall within
				predetermined height categories at maturity. The predetermined
				height categories cover off on many species' requirements and should be
				fairly balanced across the site. In some cases, identified target
				species may require particular classes to be more dominantly
				represented.</p>

			<p class="image__description">Texture describes the roughness of the foliage. This is	primarily an
				aesthetic metric that is used by the designer, however, may
				have implications for target species. Texture categories should be
				balanced across the site unless target species are identified - in
				which case beneficial classes may be more dominantly represented.</p>

			<div class="image__title">Endemism</div>
			<p class="image__description">This plot reports the proportion of species that are native to the
				country, not necessarily site, where the project will be realised. It is
				normally good practice to maximise the amount of native/local vegetation
				as other native species will have evolved to best utilise them. In some
				cases, non-aggressive exotic plants that benefit a target species or
				to create a novel ecosystem may be selected.</p>

			<div class="image__title">Richness</div>
			<p class="image__description">This plot illustrates the overall diversity and balance of plant species
				used on site. The evenness score compares the total numbers of each
				species (also depicted in the size of the gray bars) - a score close to
				zero indicates the dominance of a few species; a score of one suggests
				a more balanced representation of species. It is also important to
				examine the number of gray bars as this represents the total number of
				different species on site and should be as large as possible to
				support biodiversity.</p>

			<div class="image__title">Distribution</div>
			<p class="image__description">This plot reports an overall score that indicates how well different
				species are distributed across a site. A low value (approaching zero)
				indicates that species are clustered or clumped and unevenly distributed
				around a site. A high value (approaching one) suggests that the species
				are more randomly and evenly distributed - and closer to what we may
				encounter in an undistrurbed landscape at a smaller scale.</p>

			<div class="image__title">Coverage</div>
			<p class="image__description">This plot indicates the relative proportion of vegetation at a one meter
				cut height across the site, and how it changes through time. It is a
				coarse proxy for measuring the presence of understory vegetation on site.
				Each bar represents a year in the specified growth simulation. It is
				preferable to not see any reductions in the bar heights throughout time
				as this indicates diminishing understory as the site vegetation matures.
				The grey portions	of the bars represent the hypothetical maximums</p>

		  <div class="image__overlay">
			<div class="image__title">Phenology</div>
			<p class="image__description">Phenology is a measure of timing of recurring biological events - in
				this case, which months that plants are flowering in throughout the
				year. The bars represent the relative proportions of plants that flower
				in each respective month. In order to provide consistent resources for
				species	throughout the year, these bars should be relatively balanced.
				At a minimum, all months should have some flowering plants.</p>

		  <img class="image__img" src="connectivity.png" alt="Connectivity">
		  <div class="image__overlay">
			<div class="image__title">Connectivity</div>
			<p class="image__description">Connectivity is a measure of how much contiguous vegetation exists on
				the site. A connectivity value close to one indicates a high amount of
				contiguous or continuous vegetation throughout the site; a value closer
				to zero suggests very isolated patches of vegetation. Note, this measure
				is a composite value based on the scores obtained at five heights - by
				default 0.3m, 1.0m, 1.7m, 2.4m, and 3.1m - also indicated by the colour
				gradients in the bars (lower heights toward the inner circle). As the
				vegetation matures over time, connectivity changes, and each bar
				represents a year in the specified growth simulation. The grey portions
				of the bars represent the hypothetical maximums.</p>
